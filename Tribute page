        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p id="early life">
          Mendeleev was born in <strong>8 February 1834</strong> in the village of Verkhnie Aremzyani, near Tobolsk in Siberia.</p><p> Ivan worked as a school principal and a teacher of fine arts, politics and philosophy at the Tambov and Saratov gymnasiums.</p><p> Mendeleev was raised as an Orthodox Christian, his mother encouraging him to "patiently search divine and scientific truth". </p><p> He entered the Main Pedagogical Institute in <strong>1850</strong> in Saint Petersburg. </p><p> Between <strong>1859</strong> and <strong>1861</strong>, he worked on the capillarity of liquids and the workings of the spectroscope in Heidelberg. Later in <strong>1861</strong>, he published a textbook named Organic Chemistry. This won him the Demidov Prize of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences.  
        </p>
        <h2>Periodic table</h2>
        <p>
          After becoming a teacher in <strong>1867</strong>, Mendeleev wrote Principles of Chemistry, which became the definitive textbook of its time. </p><p> Mendeleev published his periodic table of all known elements and predicted several new elements to complete the table in a Russian-language journal. </p><p> Mendeleev also proposed changes in the properties of some known elements. Prior to his work, uranium was supposed to have valence 3 and atomic weight about 120. Mendeleev realized that these values did not fit in his periodic table, and doubled both to valence 6 and atomic weight 240 (close to the modern value of 238).
        </p>
        <h2>Later life</h2>
        <p>
          In <strong>1905</strong>, Mendeleev was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The following year the Nobel Committee for Chemistry recommended to the Swedish Academy to award the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for <strong>1906</strong> to Mendeleev for his discovery of the periodic system. He was also elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society. </p><p> In <strong>1907</strong>, Mendeleev died at the age of 72 in Saint Petersburg from influenza, just 6 days short of his 73rd birthday.
